# WeeklyPubSub

<font><b>NOTICE: This project and application is no longer supported. As a Publix Software Engineer, I haven't had time to update this project to my true vision: to web scrap Publix.com in order to retrieve the latest sub-on-sale data and display it onto the GUI for the user; thus eliminating the use for a Python Flask API. The application is still functional. This project also only served the purprose as a showcase during my professional interviews at Publix I/S ; so it is no longer needed. Please feel free to glance through the code.</b></font>

Python Flask API and Android application that easily shows consumers the sub on sale for the week at Publix Super Markets
